            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
            As students, we frequently engage with dense, high-level academic resources that are difficult to grasp without advanced knowledge. 
            We wanted to create a tool that would make these resources more digestible, helping users learn from them more effectively. 
            Additionally, students with learning disabilities often struggle with these academic resources, so we aimed to make them more accessible to this demographic. 
            Two members of our team also have immigrant parentsâ€“a central life experience that made us passionate about the premise of Clarity. 
            Recognizing the need for a tool that improves learning accessibility on the internet, we brainstormed the idea for Clarity. 
            We chose to construct the application as a web extension to make the user experience as efficient and easy as possible. 
            Ultimately, we identified a problem: many resources on the internet are too complex for a common learner who is reading about a subject for the first time. 
            Then, we created a solution to make the learning process more digestible.
